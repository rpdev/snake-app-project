            Welcome to the page for Snake App which is a new version of the classic game 'Snake' for Android smartphones.
            Here you can deepen your Snake gaming experience by creating your own custom maps using our excellent map editor.<br />
            If you lack creativity or is just very lazy you can just look at maps created by other users and download the ones
            you like the most to play on them. Afterwards you may grade the maps and comment as well as read other users
            comments.
            If you don't yet have the game on your smartphone be sure to <a href="download.jsf">download it</a> now! If you run into
            any problems please read our <a href="faq.jsf">frequently asked questions</a>.<br /><br />
            Welcome once again and enjoy your stay! / The development team
